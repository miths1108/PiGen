self join
check all tables present in condition
pk - fk join only (optimiser can introduce fk-fk by simplifying 2 pk-fk joins..see query 1a) (if join not pk-fk = > Break query)
is not null removed or converted to (col_name < EMPTYSTRING OR col_name > EMPTYSTRING)
is null changed to = EMPTYSTRING	// check appropriate replaced string
update name set n_gender = 'n' where n_gender is null;
update movie_companies set mc_note = 'EMPTYSTRING' where mc_note is null;
Breaking queries ( If C.y is in condition (A.fk = B.pk && C.fk = B.pk && C.y = 100)(C.y is that column) but has foreign key then A can't pull columns of C)


mii_movie_id not unique
mc_movie_id not unique
mk_movie_id not unique
mi_movie_id not unique
ci_movie_id not unique
